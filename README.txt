Do I need this?
---------------

If you are here probably you know about urllib https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html but
likely you either want to have a very fast implementation with handling of subtleties such as IPV6
for parsing and operating in many URLs or want a consistent implementation across C++ and Python or
have other special need.
